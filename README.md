<h2 align="left">Extra Materials and Tool Parts</h2>
<p>New feature in development.</p>
<p>Adds extra materials for vanilla and Alloygery metal types, with the goal of having an alternative way to craft tools and armor, using a new crafting interface</p>
<p><img src="readmeAssets/tool_parts_smithing_banner.png"/></p>
<p>Tools are crafted from a combination of a tool head (like a pickaxe head), a binding, and a handle</p>

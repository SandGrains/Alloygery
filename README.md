# Alloygery
<p>adding new metals and alloys to change up tools and armor while preserving a vanilla feel</p>

<p>Alloygery adds a way to make alloys from vanilla and Alloygery ores and metals.</p>
<p>The Alloy Kiln</p>

<p>and the Blast Alloy Kiln</p>

<p>Alloygery introduces a new way to craft tools out of parts made at the Smithing Anvil.</p>

<details>
<summary>Tool Update Details</summary>
<p>Tools are crafted from a combination of a tool head (like a pickaxe head), a binding, and a handle. Where each part contributes to the overall stats of the tool. Try mix and matching materials to get the best results.</p>

<p>Once you have a tool, take it over to the smithing table to apply an upgrade.</p>

<p>Upgrades are removable by using a smithing hammer.</p>

<p>By default, diamond and netherite gear are uncraftable. If you happen to come across some gear via loot or trading, you can still make use of it by salvaging the tool head.</p>

<p>Similarly, regular gear can also be dismantled this way.</p>

<p>In a similar way to tool crafting, Alloygery also changes the way armor is made.</p>

<summary>Armor Update Details</summary>
<p>Armor starts with a base layer. There are three base layers: Wool, Leather, and Chain.</p>

<p>You can craft armor plating to upgrade your armor with at the Smithing Anvil</p>

<p>Then apply those upgrades to your base armor at the Smithing Table</p>

<p>Plating can be removed at the Crafting Table by using a Crafting Hammer</p>

<p>By default, diamond and netherite armor is not craftable. You can make armor plates from any that you find as loot though.</p>

<p>There are two types of armor plating added by Alloygery. Plate, and Heavy Plate.</p>
<p>Depiction of Steel Plate applied to each base armor type.</p>

<p>Depiction of Steel Heavy Plate applied to each base armor type.</p>

<p>With the ability to dye leather and wool base layers, the possible combinations are extensive.</p>
